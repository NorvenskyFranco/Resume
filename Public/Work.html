            <li>Employed CloudWatch to monitor network, CPU, and disk usage, proactively setting up alarm triggers and notifications to alert<br/> system administrators about potential issues.</li>
            <li>Executed targeted filtering for functional/management security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to align with<br/> application and administrator requirements. Ensured secure access to the SSH server, enabling password<br/> and key-based login for over 10 users.</li>
            <li>Deployed CloudFormation templates for VPC (Virtual Public Cloud) with private and public subnets, along with EC2 (Elastic<br/> Compute Cloud) instances as needed. Enabled private communication for data stored in an S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket<br/> and created a public server for external communication through the public subnet.</li>
